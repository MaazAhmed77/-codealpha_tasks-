<h1>Hangman Game</h1>
<h3> How it works: <h3/>
<h4>The program selects a random word from a predefined list.
The user guesses one letter at a time.
The word is displayed with underscores for unguessed letters.
If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed in the word.
If the guess is incorrect, the number of allowed incorrect guesses decreases.
The game ends when the word is guessed or the incorrect guesses reach the limit. <h4/>

<h1>Basic Chatbot</h1>
<h4>Prerequisites:
To run this chatbot, you'll need to install the nltk library. You can install it using the following command: <h4/>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<h4>The nltk.chat.util.Chat class is used to create a chatbot based on predefined patterns (regular expressions) and responses.
The reflections dictionary is used to handle some basic conversational transformations, like converting "I am" to "you are".
The chatbot responds to user inputs based on matching patterns.
The conversation continues until the user types "bye" or "goodbye".</h4>

<h1>Task Automation with
Python Scripts</h1>
<H3>Scenario: Automating File Organization</H3>
<h4>If you're working on projects that include various file types (images, documents, videos, etc.), you might want to organize these files automatically into corresponding folders.</h4>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>How It Works:</h3>
<h4>Categories and Extensions: We define file categories (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos) and associated file extensions.
Organizing Files:
The script checks if a file is a regular file (not a folder).
It matches the file extension to a predefined category.
It then moves the file to the corresponding category folder.
Folder Creation: If category folders (e.g., Images, Documents) don't exist, they are automatically created.
Handling Unknown Files: Files that donâ€™t fit into any category are moved into the Others folder. </h4>
